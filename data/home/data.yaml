goals:
  - title: "Service provider and consumer separation."
    text: |-
      A service provider defines its API in terms of CRDs and associated permission claims/limitations, and exports it for use from other clusters.
  - title: "Create a standard for sharing Kubernetes native APIs."
    text: |-
      A way multiple vendors can provide services to consumers in a way that is consistent and secure.
  - title: "Building Block, Not Walled Garden."
    text: |-
      To be vendor agnostic, and to allow for a rich ecosystem of services to be provided to consumers.
